# Docker Application Deployment

Author: Divya Mahendia (M22CS006)

Here I have tried to create a simple web application, that greets the user with, "Hi, Docker!"
this is done in order to understand the concepts of Docker and containers.

Step 1: Setting Up the Development Environment (getting Docker installed):  https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/

Step 2: Creating a Directory Structure: at least two files: one for the web application code and one for the Docker configuration.

Step 3: Writing the Web Application.

Step 4: Creating a Dockerfile. (This file contains instructions for building a Docker image)

Step 5: Building the Docker Image.

Step 6: Running the Docker Container.
